Nginx Package
=============
This is a [Kurtosis package](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/packages) that starts an [Nginx container](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).

Run this package
----------------
If you have [Kurtosis installed][install-kurtosis], run:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/nginx-package
```

If you don't have Kurtosis installed, [click here to run this package on the Kurtosis playground](https://gitpod.io/#KURTOSIS_PACKAGE_LOCATOR=github.com%2Fkurtosis-tech%2Fnginx-package/https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/playground-gitpod).

To blow away the created [enclave][enclaves-reference], run `kurtosis clean -a`.

#### Result
Running this package will return a [`Service`](https://docs.kurtosis.com/starlark-reference/service) object representing the NginX service that was added. The service has one port available, with port name `http`.

#### Configuration

<details>
    <summary>Click to see configuration</summary>

You can configure this package using the JSON structure below. The default values for each parameter are shown.

NOTE: the `//` lines are not valid JSON; you will need to remove them!

```javascript
{
    // The name of the service that will be added
    "name": "nginx",

    // The image that will be started
    "image": "nginx:latest",

    // The name of a files artifact (https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/files-artifacts) containing one
    // or more Nginx .conf files (https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/), for
    // example nginx.conf
    // If not supplied, no custom configuration will be loaded
    "config_files_artifact": ""
}
```

The arguments can then be passed in to `kurtosis run`.

For example:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/nginx-package '{"name":"Maynard James Keenan"}'
```

You can also store the JSON args in a file, and use command expansion to slot them in:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/nginx-package "$(cat args.json)"
```
